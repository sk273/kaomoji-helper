# kaomoji-helper

A lightweight solution to typing kaomoji painlessly. Written in HTML and javscript with a splash of Angular.

## Getting Started

Simply download the source code and load the unpacked extension in Chrome. Using the extension is simple -- just type the kaomoji's name or number in between two semicolons and the extension will turn it into a kaomoji. For instance, typing ";shrug;" will give you "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

## Known Issues

Because websites use a variety of different methods to deal with text input, the extension doesn't yet work in all cases. Since the extension basically modifies the text content of the HTML element, the extension may cause issues with sites like Facebook that seem to keep track of user inputs rather than the actual displayed text. We will tackle these issues in future versions but feel free to fork and fix the problem yourself if you are feeling inspired!
